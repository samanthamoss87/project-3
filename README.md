# Vision Telematics
The purpose of this Python console application, is to allow potential customers who have an interest in telematics, to answer a few simple questions in order to determine the best telematics product/solution to meet their needs. This directly relates to the Project 1 & 2 website (RS Vision Consulting) and will plan to build upon further in project 4 and 5 where we intend to build a complete "Telematics solution wizard" with a front and backend service. This will effectively allow potential customer to register their interest, navigate through some interactive questions / options and present product information/comparisons". This will be designed to take customers through a typical fact finding process which would normally be undertaken by a sales person in an automated way. We will also look to build a quote and potentially allow the customer to order online where currently this is not possible.
